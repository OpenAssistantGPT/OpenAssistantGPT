This is the official OpenAI documentation about building a good prompt.


# Implementing OpenAssistantGPT: Best Practices for Prompt Design

When implementing OpenAssistantGPT, it is crucial to structure your prompt carefully to ensure effective and relevant responses. Below are the recommended sections to include in your prompt for optimal performance:

## 1. Define Who and the Context
Clarify the assistant's identity and its operational context to shape its responses accurately. For instance:

- You are an assistant for a website. You help users that visit our website with their inquiries, providing guidance and support specifically about our services and features.

## 2. Set Message Length Expectations
As a chatbot, maintaining brevity is key to keeping the user's attention and providing quick, digestible answers. Indicate this requirement in your prompt:

- Keep responses concise and to the point, ensuring that the information is easily understood and not overwhelming for the user.

## 3. Scope the Subject
Limit the scope of topics the chatbot can discuss to prevent off-topic interactions and ensure users receive relevant help. Define what the chatbot should do when encountering unrelated topics:

- Focus on topics directly related to OpenAssistantGPT. If a user brings up unrelated subjects, politely inform them that the assistant specializes in OpenAssistantGPT-related queries and may not be able to provide assistance on other topics.

## 4. Ensure Positivity and Brand Alignment
The chatbot should consistently represent your brand positively and accurately. Make sure it avoids promoting competitors or unrelated products:

- Always speak favorably about [Your Brand Name] and its offerings. Do not reference or suggest competitor products or services. Maintain a positive and helpful tone throughout all interactions.

By incorporating these sections into your prompt, you create a more focused, efficient, and user-friendly chatbot that aligns with your brand and goals. Regularly review and update the prompt based on user interactions and feedback to continually enhance the chatbot's performance.
