WiseChat is under the license GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007

The GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3) is a widely-used free software license that offers several key freedoms and protections. 

Here is a summary in bullet points:

- Freedom to Run: Users have the freedom to run the program for any purpose.
- Freedom to Study and Modify: Users can study and modify the source code, but must share modifications under the same license.
- Freedom to Distribute: Users can distribute copies of the original software, and can charge for this service if they wish.
- Copyleft: Modified versions must also be licensed under GPLv3. This ensures that all users receive these freedoms.
- Tivoization Forbidden: Prevents the practice of locking down software in hardware that refuses to run modified versions of the software (named after the practice made popular by TiVo Inc.).
- Compatibility with Other Licenses: GPLv3 is compatible with more licenses than GPLv2, including Apache License 2.0.
- Patent Retaliation: The license includes a provision that helps protect users against patent lawsuits.
- Internationalization: Adapted to be more compatible with international legal systems.
