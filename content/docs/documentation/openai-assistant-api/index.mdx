OpenAssistantGPT uses the OpenAI Assistant API to build its smart chatbot. This is why it is essential to familiarize yourself with their [main documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) before getting started with our platform.

When employing the assistant, we make use of the retrieval function, meaning we only support gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 and gpt-4-1106-preview models. For a better understanding of this retrieval function, we highly recommend reading the official documentation on [Knowledge Retrieval](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/knowledge-retrieval).
But with the new Assistant V2 we now support the latest model GPT-4o.


GPT-4 may not be available for you the reason why is because you haven't use OpenAI enough. You need to reach at least tier 1. For additional information on tiers, you can find more details [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers?context=tier-one) about tiers.
